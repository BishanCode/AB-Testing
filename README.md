##  Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Merged user data with country info
   - Removed duplicates and inconsistent rows
   - Verified group assignments (control → old page, treatment → new page)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Checked group balance (≈50/50 split)
   - Checked country distribution across groups
   - Calculated overall and country-level conversion rates

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Two-proportion z-test for conversion difference
   - Confidence intervals for conversion rates
   - Tested for balance using chi-square
   - Logistic regression (optional) adjusting for country

4. **Visualisation**
   - Conversion rate comparison (control vs treatment)
   - Conversion by country
   - Funnel-style summary

5. **Dashboard (Power BI)**
   - KPIs: conversion rate, absolute lift, p-value
   - Country-level breakdown
   - Filters for interactivity

## 📊 Key Results
- **Control conversion rate:** X%  
- **Treatment conversion rate:** Y%  
- **Absolute lift:** Δ%  
- **p-value:** p = Z  

➡️ **Decision:** The new landing page did *not* produce a statistically significant improvement. Rollout not recommended at this time.
